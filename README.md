Broxy is an open source intercept proxy written in Go. It makes use of [goproxy](https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy) as core proxy implementation and the interface is implemented with a [Qt wrapper](https://github.com/therecipe/qt) for Go.

**DISCLAIMER:** this is a PoC to understand the feseability of the project. As a result of this test a new project has spawn, named [yves](https://github.com/rhaidiz/yves).
